# Introduction

The dataset analysed in this report provides information about **`r nrow(col_accidents_subset)`** deaths caused by motorcycle accidents in MedellÃ­n, a Colombian city, from 2012 to 2015. The data is sourced from medical and police certificates and can be accessed [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4836304).

# Age-sex distribution of motorcyle deaths

In this analysis, we looked at the number of deaths per age and sex group.

```{r}
# Print your graph here.

```

```{r}
# TASK 9: ADD INLINE CODE AND COMMENTARY 

## Each of the 3 statistics in this code chunk will be quoted in the text below.

max_sex_group <- age_sex_count %>% 
  filter(n == max(n)) %>% 
  pull(gender)

max_age_group <- age_sex_count %>% 
  "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"

max_n_deaths <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

The age group with the most fatal accidents was `r paste0(max_sex_group, "s")` aged `"WRITE_YOUR_INLINE_CODE_HERE"`, with `"WRITE_YOUR_INLINE_CODE_HERE"` deaths.

## Analysis of Driver Position 

We further analyzed the position of the driver involved in these accidents for the age-sex group with the most fatal accidents. 

The table below shows the breakdown of accidents by driver position:
